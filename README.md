Least square regression method for m degree polynomial
This repo is a solution for the first home work, for course Advanced traffic theory, Fall
2017 , taught by Dr. Christian Claudel at University of Texas at Austin.

The problem is mainly related to the method of least square, targeting concepts like over fitting,
under fitting and exploring different the effect of choosing the degree of a polynomial on the fitting
behavior of a specific dataset. The first section will present the problem itself, followed by the
second section which show how to do a least square fitting for m degree polynomial, then the
third section contains answers for the questions.
